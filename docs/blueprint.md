# **App Name**: Golf Physics Simulator

## Core Features:

- Physics Engine: Simulate projectile motion using adjustable parameters like launch angle, initial velocity, gravity, and air resistance.
- Parameter Input: Use sliders to dynamically adjust launch angle, initial velocity, gravity, ball mass, ball diameter, and air resistance with real-time numeric readouts.
- Visual Trajectory Display: Display an aiming arc and direction arrow that updates dynamically as the angle or force is changed.
- Animation and Controls: Animate the golf ball along a parabolic path, with trajectory dots and a path trail. Include controls for Swing, Pause, Play, Slow Motion, Clear Path, and Reset.
- Data Overlay: Display flight time, horizontal distance, maximum height, speed at launch, and speed on impact in a compact data overlay.
- Dynamic Background & Zoom: Add zoom in and zoom out buttons and create the perception of a shift to the background during ball flight.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A lively, grassy green (#8BC34A) to reflect the golf course setting and bring the game to life.
- Background color: A serene, desaturated sky blue (#E1F5FE) that offers a calm contrast to the green.
- Accent color: An energetic yellow-green (#9ACD32) to make interactive elements and data overlays stand out.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, providing a neutral and readable style suitable for educational tools.
- Use vector icons for control buttons to provide clarity and ease of use.
- Employ smooth, realistic animation for the ball's trajectory and subtle transitions for user interactions.
- The control panel follows the PhET style of layout to increase the familiarity and approachability of the design.
